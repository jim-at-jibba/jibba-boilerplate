Static starter template
===============================

This is how I start all my projects. Bower and npm make it easy to install packages (like Foundation or Bootstrap) and keep them up to date.
Gulp is awesome and allows you to run common tasks prgramically from the CLI. Huge increase in speed.

## Instructions for use:

System requirements - node.js (& npm) and bower, both are easily installed. Follow the links below.

  node.js - http://nodejs.org/download/
  bower - http://bower.io/
  gulp - http://gulpjs.com/

1. Copy this entire folder to where you want it.
2. Rename it according.
3. Start your Terminal - For windows I recommend Cmder, download here - http://bliker.github.io/cmder/
4. cd into directory
5. Run Bower install to install dependencies.
6. Run npm install to install gulp and it dependency.
7. Run gulp command
3. should be good to go.

n.b - included scss and the scss file structure is set and ready to go.
